# todolist
This is a todo list console based project I created in Python using the sqlite3 library (database) for personal use. 

To run this project, just enter python taskManagerSQLite.py into the command prompt of the correct directory.

This idea stems from some family members of mine having issues tracking
house projects they wish to get done which is where the three parameters of cost, ease, and priority stem from
